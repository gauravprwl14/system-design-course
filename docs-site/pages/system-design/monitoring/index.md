# Monitoring & Observability

> Know what's happening in your production systems

## 📋 Overview

You can't fix what you can't see. Monitoring and observability are essential for maintaining reliable systems at scale. Learn how to instrument, monitor, and debug distributed systems.

## 🎯 Golden Signals (Google SRE)

1. **Latency** - How long requests take
2. **Traffic** - How many requests
3. **Errors** - How many failures
4. **Saturation** - How full your system is

## 📊 Essential Metrics

### Application Metrics
- Request rate (req/sec)
- Response time (p50, p95, p99)
- Error rate (%)
- Success rate (%)

### System Metrics
- CPU usage (%)
- Memory usage (%)
- Disk I/O
- Network I/O

### Database Metrics
- Query latency
- Connection pool usage
- Cache hit rate
- Replication lag
