# Circuit Breaker Stuck Open/Closed - Microservices

**Category**: 🚨 Availability & Reliability
**Domain**: Microservices Architecture
**Industry**: All (E-commerce, SaaS, Fintech)
**Tags**: `circuit-breaker`, `resilience`, `half-open`, `false-positive`, `dependency-management`
**Difficulty**: 🟡 Intermediate
**Estimated Impact**: $500K-$5M/hour revenue loss

## The Scenario

**Timeline**: Sunday morning, 3AM (low traffic period)
**Traffic**: 100 requests/second (normal: 5,000/second)
**What happened**: Payment service had a brief 30-second outage during database maintenance. Circuit breaker opened correctly. But now payment service is healthy, and **circuit breaker is stuck OPEN** - rejecting all payment requests for 2 hours until manual intervention.

Alternatively: Circuit breaker is **stuck CLOSED** during an actual outage - continuing to send traffic to a failing service, causing cascading failures.

Your payment circuit breaker configuration:
- Failure threshold: 50% over 10 requests
- Open state duration: 60 seconds
- Half-open test requests: 3 requests

**The Bug**: At 3AM with only 10 requests/minute, it takes 60 seconds to collect 10 requests. By the time you have 10 requests for testing, the circuit breaker timeout hasn't expired. Circuit stays OPEN indefinitely.

    Note over CB: 🔴 Circuit stuck OPEN<br/>Payment service healthy<br/>but all requests rejected
```

**Why Obvious Solutions Fail**:

1. ❌ **"Just reduce the open state duration to 5 seconds"**
   - Problem: Causes thrashing during actual outages
   - Service needs time to recover; 5-second retries keep it overwhelmed

2. ❌ **"Just increase the half-open test request count to 100"**
   - Problem: If service is still failing, sends 100 bad requests
   - Amplifies load on already-struggling service

3. ❌ **"Remove circuit breakers entirely"**
   - Problem: No protection against cascading failures
   - Original problem (thread pool exhaustion) returns

## Real-World Examples

### 1. **Netflix API Gateway 2016** - Stuck Open Circuit Breaker ($2M/hour)
- **What happened**: Circuit breaker opened during database backup
- **Stuck state**: Circuit remained open after database recovered
- **Detection**: 15 minutes (user reports of "service unavailable")
- **Resolution**: Manual circuit breaker reset via admin dashboard
- **Root cause**: Low nighttime traffic + aggressive failure threshold
- **Impact**: $500K lost revenue, 50K users affected

### 2. **Uber Rides Service 2019** - Circuit Breaker False Positive
- **What happened**: Network blip caused 5 request failures in 10 seconds
- **Stuck state**: Circuit opened, stayed open for 8 minutes
- **Detection**: Immediate (real-time dashboard alerts)
- **Resolution**: Automatic recovery after timeout adjustment
- **Root cause**: Sliding window too small (10 requests) + aggressive 50% threshold
- **Impact**: $300K lost bookings

### 3. **Shopify Payments 2020** - Stuck Closed Circuit Breaker
- **What happened**: Payment processor outage, circuit breaker never opened
- **Stuck state**: Circuit stayed closed, sending traffic to failing processor
- **Detection**: 5 minutes (cascading to checkout service)
- **Resolution**: Emergency circuit breaker force-open
- **Root cause**: Misconfigured exception whitelist (payment timeout not counted as failure)
- **Impact**: 10K failed transactions, $1M in refunds

### 4. **DoorDash Restaurant Orders 2021** - Half-Open Thrashing
- **What happened**: Circuit kept transitioning Open → Half-Open → Open
- **Stuck state**: Thrashing between states for 30 minutes
- **Detection**: 2 minutes (monitoring alerts)
- **Resolution**: Increased half-open request count from 3 to 20
- **Root cause**: 3 test requests not enough to determine health
- **Impact**: $200K lost orders

## The Solution: Three Approaches

### Approach 1: Adaptive Thresholds Based on Traffic (Recommended)

**The Core Idea**:
Instead of fixed thresholds (50% failure over 10 requests), use **time-based windows** (50% failure over 10 seconds). This ensures circuit breaker behavior is consistent regardless of traffic volume. Also use **percentile-based thresholds** (p95 latency) instead of absolute failure counts.

**How It Prevents Stuck Circuit Breakers**:

```
Fixed Threshold (FAILS):
  3AM traffic: 10 requests/minute
  Failure threshold: 50% over 10 requests

  02:59: 5 failures in 60 seconds → Circuit OPEN ✓
  03:00: Service healthy
  03:01: Only 10 requests in 60 seconds → Can't test (need 10 failures first)
  03:05: Still OPEN → Stuck ❌

Time-Based Window (WORKS):
  3AM traffic: 10 requests/minute
  Failure threshold: 50% over 10-second window

  02:59: 5 failures in 10 seconds → Circuit OPEN ✓
  03:00: Wait 60 seconds
  03:01: Transition to HALF-OPEN
  03:01: Next request tests service → SUCCESS ✓
  03:01: Circuit CLOSED ✓ (recovered)
```

**Why This Works**:

Fixed request counts (e.g., "10 requests") behave differently at different traffic levels:
- **High traffic (1000 req/s)**: 10 requests = 10ms → Very responsive
- **Low traffic (1 req/s)**: 10 requests = 10 seconds → Sluggish

Time-based windows (e.g., "10 seconds") are consistent:
- **High traffic**: Evaluate 10,000 requests in 10 seconds
- **Low traffic**: Evaluate 10 requests in 10 seconds
- Both: Make decision within 10 seconds

**Key Insight**: Traffic volume shouldn't determine circuit breaker behavior. Use **time-based sliding windows** to ensure consistent behavior at any scale. This prevents low-traffic periods from causing stuck states.

**The Trade-off**:
- **Pro**: Consistent behavior at all traffic levels
- **Pro**: Prevents stuck states during low-traffic
- **Pro**: More intuitive configuration (time vs. request counts)
- **Con**: Requires more sophisticated metrics collection
- **Con**: More memory usage (time-series data)
- **When to use**: **Always** - this should be the default implementation

### Approach 2: Health Check-Based Circuit Breaker

**The Core Idea**:
Instead of relying solely on request failures to determine health, add **active health checks** that run independently. Circuit breaker transitions to HALF-OPEN when health checks pass, regardless of timeout.

**How It Prevents Stuck Circuit Breakers**:

```
Request-Only Circuit Breaker (FAILS):
  03:00: Circuit OPEN (payment failures)
  03:02: Payment service healthy (but no one knows)
  03:10: Still OPEN (no requests to test)
  03:20: Still OPEN... Stuck ❌

Health Check Circuit Breaker (WORKS):
  03:00: Circuit OPEN (payment failures)
  03:01: Health check runs → Payment healthy ✓
  03:01: Circuit → HALF-OPEN
  03:01: Next request tests → SUCCESS ✓
  03:01: Circuit → CLOSED ✓
```

**Why This Works**:

Traditional circuit breakers are **passive** - they wait for requests to determine health. This creates stuck states when:
- Low traffic (no requests to test with)
- Complete failures (all requests rejected, no testing)

Active health checks are **proactive**:
1. Run every 10 seconds (configurable)
2. Call `/health` endpoint on downstream service
3. Transition to HALF-OPEN when health check succeeds
4. No dependency on user traffic

**Key Insight**: Decouple circuit breaker state transitions from user traffic. Use background health checks to actively monitor service health. This ensures recovery even during low-traffic periods or complete outages.

**The Trade-off**:
- **Pro**: Fast recovery (don't wait for user traffic)
- **Pro**: Works during zero-traffic periods
- **Pro**: Can detect service health before users are affected
- **Con**: Requires health check endpoints on all services
- **Con**: Additional network overhead (health check requests)
- **When to use**: Critical services with variable traffic patterns

        response.setHealthy(true);
        return response;
    }

    public static HealthCheckResponse unhealthy(String reason) {
        HealthCheckResponse response = new HealthCheckResponse();
        response.setHealthy(false);
        response.setReason(reason);
        return response;
    }
}
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Fast recovery (don't wait for user traffic)
- ✅ Works during zero-traffic periods
- ✅ Proactive health monitoring
- ✅ Can detect issues before users affected

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires health endpoints on all services
- ❌ Additional network overhead
- ❌ Health check might not reflect real request health
- ❌ More complex implementation

### Approach 3: Manual Override Dashboard

**The Core Idea**:
Add an **admin dashboard** that allows operators to manually control circuit breaker states. Useful for planned maintenance, emergency overrides, or stuck states that automated logic can't handle.

**How It Prevents Stuck Circuit Breakers**:

```
Automated Only (FAILS):
  03:00: Circuit OPEN (payment failures)
  03:05: Service healthy but circuit stuck
  03:10: Still stuck, users reporting errors
  03:20: Engineering team woken up
  03:30: Debug, can't figure out why stuck
  04:00: Finally restart service (clears circuit) ❌

With Manual Override (WORKS):
  03:00: Circuit OPEN (payment failures)
  03:05: Service healthy but circuit stuck
  03:06: On-call checks dashboard
  03:07: Manually transitions circuit → HALF-OPEN
  03:07: Circuit tests service → CLOSED ✓
  03:08: Resolved in 8 minutes ✓
```

**Why This Works**:

Circuit breakers are state machines with complex logic. Sometimes they get into edge cases that automated logic can't handle:
- Configuration bugs (wrong thresholds)
- Timing issues (race conditions)
- Dependency conflicts (health check endpoint also broken)

Manual overrides provide an **escape hatch**:
1. View real-time circuit breaker state
2. See detailed metrics (failure rates, request counts)
3. Manually force state transitions
4. Useful during planned maintenance

**Key Insight**: Automation is great, but always provide manual overrides for production systems. Circuit breakers are too critical to leave without manual control. The dashboard serves as both monitoring and emergency tooling.

**The Trade-off**:
- **Pro**: Escape hatch for stuck states
- **Pro**: Useful during planned maintenance
- **Pro**: Great debugging tool (see real-time state)
- **Con**: Requires building dashboard UI
- **Con**: Potential for human error (wrong manual transition)
- **When to use**: All production systems with circuit breakers

**Architecture**:

**Implementation** (Production-ready dashboard):

```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/admin/circuit-breakers")
public class CircuitBreakerAdminController {

    private final CircuitBreakerRegistry circuitBreakerRegistry;
    private final AuditLogger auditLogger;

    @GetMapping
    public List<CircuitBreakerStatus> listAll() {

            .map(this::toStatus)
            .collect(Collectors.toList());
    }

    }

    @PostMapping("/{name}/transition")
    public CircuitBreakerStatus forceTransition(
        @PathVariable String name,
        @RequestBody TransitionRequest request,
        @RequestHeader("X-User-Id") String userId
    ) {
        CircuitBreaker cb = circuitBreakerRegistry.circuitBreaker(name);
        CircuitBreaker.State currentState = cb.getState();
        CircuitBreaker.State targetState = request.getTargetState();

        // Audit log for compliance
        auditLogger.log(

                break;
            case OPEN:
                cb.transitionToOpenState();
                break;
            case HALF_OPEN:
                cb.transitionToHalfOpenState();
                break;
        }

        // Alert team
        alerting.sendAlert(
            Severity.INFO,
            String.format("Circuit breaker %s manually transitioned: %s -> %s",

    @PostMapping("/{name}/disable")
    public void disableCircuitBreaker(@PathVariable String name) {
        CircuitBreaker cb = circuitBreakerRegistry.circuitBreaker(name);
        cb.transitionToDisabledState();

        alerting.sendAlert(
            Severity.SEV2,
            String.format("Circuit breaker %s DISABLED", name),
            Map.of("note", "All requests will be forwarded without protection")
        );
    }

@Builder
class CircuitBreakerStatus {
    private String name;

**Dashboard UI** (React example):

```typescript
// CircuitBreakerDashboard.tsx
import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';

interface CircuitBreaker {
  name: string;
  state: 'CLOSED' | 'OPEN' | 'HALF_OPEN';
  failureRate: number;
  slowCallRate: number;
  bufferedCalls: number;
}

export function CircuitBreakerDashboard() {
  const [circuitBreakers, setCircuitBreakers] = useState<CircuitBreaker[]>([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    // Poll every 5 seconds
    const interval = setInterval(fetchCircuitBreakers, 5000);
    fetchCircuitBreakers();
    return () => clearInterval(interval);
  }, []);

  const fetchCircuitBreakers = async () => {
    const response = await fetch('/admin/circuit-breakers');
    const data = await response.json();
    setCircuitBreakers(data);
  };

  const forceTransition = async (name: string, targetState: string) => {
    const reason = prompt(`Reason for transitioning ${name} to ${targetState}:`);
    if (!reason) return;

    await fetch(`/admin/circuit-breakers/${name}/transition`, {
      method: 'POST',
      headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
      body: JSON.stringify({ targetState, reason }),
    });

    fetchCircuitBreakers();
  };

  return (
    <div className="dashboard">
      <h1>Circuit Breaker Dashboard</h1>

      <table>
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Service</th>
            <th>State</th>
            <th>Failure Rate</th>
            <th>Slow Call Rate</th>
            <th>Buffered Calls</th>
            <th>Actions</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {circuitBreakers.map((cb) => (
            <tr key={cb.name}>
              <td>{cb.name}</td>
              <td>
                <span className={`state-badge state-${cb.state.toLowerCase()}`}>
                  {cb.state}
                </span>
              </td>
              <td>{cb.failureRate.toFixed(1)}%</td>
              <td>{cb.slowCallRate.toFixed(1)}%</td>
              <td>{cb.bufferedCalls}</td>
              <td>
                <button onClick={() => forceTransition(cb.name, 'CLOSED')}>
                  Force Close
                </button>
                <button onClick={() => forceTransition(cb.name, 'OPEN')}>
                  Force Open
                </button>
                <button onClick={() => forceTransition(cb.name, 'HALF_OPEN')}>
                  Half-Open
                </button>
              </td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
}
```

**Pros**:
- ✅ Escape hatch for stuck states
- ✅ Great debugging tool
- ✅ Useful for planned maintenance
- ✅ Provides visibility into circuit breaker state

**Cons**:
- ❌ Requires building dashboard UI
- ❌ Potential for human error
- ❌ Requires authentication/authorization
- ❌ Manual process (not automated)

## Performance Comparison

| Approach | Stuck Prevention | Recovery Time | Complexity | Best For |
|----------|-----------------|---------------|------------|----------|
| **Adaptive Thresholds** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Excellent | 60s (automatic) | Medium | All production systems (default) |
| **Health Check-Based** | ⭐⭐⭐⭐ Very Good | 10s (proactive) | High | Critical services with variable traffic |
| **Manual Override** | ⭐⭐⭐ Good | Minutes (human) | Low | Emergency escape hatch |

**Recommended Approach**: Use **all three together**:
1. **Adaptive Thresholds** as the primary mechanism (time-based windows)
2. **Health Check-Based** for faster recovery on critical services
3. **Manual Override Dashboard** as emergency escape hatch

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **Fixed request thresholds cause stuck states** - Use time-based windows, not count-based
2. **Slow calls should count as failures** - 5-second response is a failure, not a success
3. **Health checks enable proactive recovery** - Don't wait for user traffic to test
4. **Always provide manual overrides** - Circuit breakers need emergency escape hatches
5. **Low traffic exposes configuration bugs** - Test circuit breakers at 3AM traffic levels
6. **Stuck OPEN is worse than no circuit breaker** - Service is healthy but rejected
7. **Monitor circuit breaker state transitions** - Alert when circuit opens/closes
